### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [IvLabs](https://www.ivlabs.in/), an AI and Robotics community.
- ðŸŒ± I have been learning and tinkering with Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Computing, Deep Learning and NLP.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'd be glad to collaborate over Quantum Machine Learning, Deep Learning or Physics research and projects.
- ðŸ˜„ I plan on studying and teaching theoretical physics, specifically, Quantum Mechanics.
- ðŸ’¬ Send me emails, papers or poems if you want to talk about literature, physics or anything.
- ðŸ“« You can ping me at khurshed.p.fitter@gmail.com
- ðŸ¤” I find myself pondering over human thought processes, a bit too much.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am not even fit, let alone Fitter X)
